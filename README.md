# Milestone-Project

## Main concept
An online game where a user clicks a button to produce a random number on a dice. If the random number lands on 1 the game switches user. Else if the random number is !==1 current player keeps rolling dice and a score is added up to a variable highScore.

User should be able to start and reset game to initial start positions.

# Game Requirements

    - This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)

    - The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI

    - For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players

    - This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)

    - When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts

    - If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented

    - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files

    - Effort must be spent on styling and appearance

    - The HTML code should use sematic tags

    -The game should have a Readme.md file in the Github repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
