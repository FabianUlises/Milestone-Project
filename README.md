This milestone project is meant to put into practice skills learned in 
2 (HTML & Web Accessibility),
3 (CSS, SASS, & CSS Frameworks), 
4 (User Experience & User Interface Design), and 5 (JavaScript & Front-End Web Development)

Let's make an in-browser game to practice our skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Which game is up to you so long as you meet the requirements listed below. Almost any 
game will give us some great practice with DOM manipulation, events, and control flow
